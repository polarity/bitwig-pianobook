# Pianobook - Bitwig Presets

[Pianobook Website](https://www.pianobook.co.uk/)

> Curated by one of the founders of SPITFIRE AUDIO pianobook is a collective sample project that aims to bring together a community of likeminded music makers to talk about their stories through the pianos they use, admire and are inspired by.
> The start point is the belief that every piano has a story, we will tell that story and then, as part of that narrative, sample the piano to preserve it at that point of its timeline. Christian Henson will then take these samples and mutate them (with the input of this community) into a whole new world of inspiring sounds, textures and instruments.
> pianobook is a place to share stories, create something extraordinary, and learn something new about each other and our ourselves.

Many of the Pianobook Kontakt patches are not 100% reproducible as Bitwig Sampler patches. However, I tried my best to integrate the pianos as good as possible into Bitwig.
